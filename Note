âš¡ Voltage Divider Circuit for Analog Sensors
Since ESP32â€™s analog input pins support only up to 3.3V, sensors outputting up to 5V (e.g., rain sensor) require a voltage divider.

Example:

5V Sensor Output
   |
  R1 = 10kÎ©

   |-----> To ESP32 ADC (max 3.3V)
   |
  R2 = 20kÎ©

  GND
ðŸ”„ NPN Transistor Circuit for 5V DC Fan
To control a 5V fan with ESP32 (3.3V logic), an NPN transistor acts as a switch.

Circuit:

ESP32 GPIO â†’ 1kÎ© â†’ NPN Base

NPN Collector â†’ Fan Negative

Fan Positive â†’ 5V

NPN Emitter â†’ GND

Add flyback diode across fan terminals (e.g., 1N4007) for protection.
